What's this about?
------------------

vdrnfofs creates a virtual Fuse-based file system that maps recordings
from the Linux Video Disc Recorder (VDR) to *.nfo and *.mpg files.

Those files can then e.g. used by media center applications like.
XBMC or Enna.

Such a thing has been tried previously here:

  http://code.google.com/p/vdrfs/

But this project seems to be abandoned, so I've rebuilt vdrnfofs from scratch.

VDR recordings (PS or TS) are simply mapped 1:1 to *.mpg files. If the VDR recording
is split to multiple files, they are virtually concatenated to a single *.mpg file.

The *.nfo is a XML file with the follwing structure:

  <movie>
    <title>...</title>
    <plot>...</plot>
  </movie>

Title and plot are mapped from VDR's info file ('T' and 'D').


How to install?
---------------

In order to be able to use vdrnofs, python-setuptools and python-fuse are
required.

If not installing from a package of your preferred Linux distribution run:

  ./setup.py install

The user which should be able to mount vdrnfofs should be a member of the 
group "fuse".


How to use?
-----------

To mount a vdrnfofs file system, run:

  vdrnfofs <mount-point> -o video=<vdr-vide-dir>

e.g.:

   vdrnfofs /mnt/vdrnfofs -o video=/var/lib/video

You can also do this in /erc/fstab with:

   vdrnfofs    /mnt/vdrnfofs   fuse    video=/var/lib/video 0 0
